A website aggregator is a website that collects data from other websites across the internet and puts the information in one place where visitors can access it.

Steps to start server:

- install client and server dependencies
- currently this project can only be run locally as chatGPT api is not that much stable
- create a .env file in server folder and add the following keys:
  - CHATGPT_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  - CHATGPT_PASSWORD
